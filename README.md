## PROJECT: Open Source HomeBrew Repeater Protocol Client/Master. ##

**UPDATES:**

**PURPOSE:** Thanks to the work of Jonathan Naylor, G4KLX; Hans Barthen, DL5DI; Torsten Shultze, DG1HT we have an open protocol for internetworking DMR repeaters. Unfortunately, there's no generic client and/or master stacks. This project is to build an open-source, python-based implementation. You are free to use this software however you want, however we ask that you provide attribution in some public venue (such as project, club, organization web site). This helps us see where the software is in use and track how it is used.

For those who will ask: This is a piece of software that implements an open-source, amateur radio networking protocol. It is not a network. It is not intended to be a network. It is not intended to replace or circumvent a network. People do those things, code doesn't.
  
**PROPERTY:**  
This work represents the author's interpretation of the HomeBrew Repeater Protocol, based on the 2015-07-26 documents from DMRplus, "IPSC Protocol Specs for homebrew DMR repeater" as written by Jonathan Naylor, G4KLX; Hans Barthen, DL5DI; Torsten Shultze, DG1HT, also licenced under Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license.

**WARRANTY**
None. The owners of this work make absolutely no warranty, express or implied. Use this software at your own risk.

**PRE-REQUISITE KNOWLEDGE:**  
This document assumes the reader is familiar with Linux/UNIX, the Python programming language and DMR.  

**Using docker version**

Docker file included for own image build
To work with provided docker setup you will need:
* A private repository with your configuration files (all .cfg files in repo will be copyed to the application root directory on start up)
* A service user able to read your private repository (or be brave and publish your configuration, or be really brave and give your username and password to the docker)
* A server with docker installed
* Follow this simple steps:

Build your own image from source

```bash

docker build . -t hblink3/hblink3:latest

```

Or user a prebuilt one in docker hub: shaymez/hblink3:latest
This image is multi-arch

Wake up your container

```bash
touch /var/log/hblink.log
chown 54000 -R /var/log/hblink.log
 run -v /var/log/hblink/hblink.log:/var/log/hblink/hblink.log -e GIT_USER=$USER -e GIT_PASSWORD=$PASSWORD -e GIT_REPO=$URL_TO_REPO_WITHOUT_HTTPS://  -p 54000:54000  shaymez/hblink3:latest
 ```

**MORE DOCUMENTATION TO COME**
